# BhoomiSetu

**A GIS-enabled land acquisition and rehabilitation platform · SIH26016**

BhoomiSetu brings citizens, field officers and administrators into one shared
workflow—from acquisition notification to possession. It makes case progress,
compensation records, grievances and project performance easier to track.

## Key features

- **Five role portals:** Citizen, Field Officer, Project Authority, District Administrator and Senior Administrator, with role-based and case-level access.
- **Case management:** Six-stage acquisition journey, document review, grievance routing and tamper-evident audit history.
- **GIS mapping:** Interactive parcel maps backed by PostgreSQL/PostGIS and OpenStreetMap reference tiles.
- **Compensation and rehabilitation:** Recorded payment status, R&R progress, affected/displaced family counts and due dates.
- **Dashboards and reporting:** Eight KPI groups, project/state comparisons, timeline alerts, customizable CSV reports and print/save-to-PDF.
- **Document and predictive assistance:** Tesseract OCR with protected original-scan comparison and citizen-visible rejection reasons, grievance classification, delay-risk estimates and compensation timeline estimates.
- **Accessibility:** Responsive mobile layouts; English, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati and Kannada labels; citizen read-aloud with a server audio fallback.

## Acquisition workflow

**Notification → Verification → Objection → Award → Compensation → Possession**

Citizens follow their cases and raise grievances. Officers review documents and
record progress. Authorities and administrators manage compensation/R&R records,
monitor exceptions and compare project performance.

## Demo and model scope

Demo cases and the **1,800 ML training records are synthetic**. No real government
case data was used to train the models. These are synthetic holdout results,
**not real-world accuracy**:

| Model | MAE | R² |
|---|---:|---:|
| Delay prediction | 12.92 days | 0.951 |
| Compensation timeline | 5.83 days | 0.898 |

Predictions estimate time, not compensation amounts or legal entitlements.
Government adapters are demonstration fixtures. OpenStreetMap is map reference
data, not ML training data; attribution belongs to
